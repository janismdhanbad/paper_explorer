Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

Most current research upsamples the visual features along the time dimension so that audio and video features are able to align in time. However, we believe that lip movement should mostly contain long-term, or phone-level information. Based on this assumption, we propose a new way to fuse audio-visual features. We observe that for DPRNN \\cite{dprnn}, the interchunk dimension's time resolution could be very close to the time resolution of video frames. Like \\cite{sepformer}, the LSTM in DPRNN is replaced by intra-chunk and inter-chunk self-attention, but in the proposed algorithm, inter-chunk attention incorporates the visual features as an additional feature stream.

Personalisation is typically achieved by extracting a target speaker's voice profile from an enrolment audio, in the form of a static embedding vector, and then using it to condition the output of a PSE model.

Our new analysis shows clearly that price impact and volume are related by a square-root functional form of market impact for large volumes, in contrast to the claim of FL that this relationship increases as a power law with a smaller exponent. Since large orders are usually executed by splitting into smaller size trades, procedures used by FL give a downward bias for this power law exponent. Second, FL analyze 3 stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange, and solely on this basis they claim that the distribution of transaction volumes do not have a power-law tail for the London Stock Exchange. We perform new empirical analysis on transaction data for the 262 largest stocks listed in the London Stock Exchange, and find that the distribution of volume decays as a power-law with an exponent $\\approx 3/2$ -- in sharp contrast to FL's claim that the distribution of transaction volume does not have a power-law tail.

The key tool in MPT is an analysis of an empirical covariance matrix. This matrix, obtained from historical data is biased by such a high amount of statistical uncertainty, that it can be seen as random.

In multi-scale analysis; clearly identifiable 1, 2 and 3 year non-stationary periodic modulations in NYSE and BSE have been observed, with NYSE commensurating changes in BSE at 3 years scale. Interestingly, at one year time scale, the two exchanges are phase locked only during the turbulent times, while at the scale of three year, in-phase nature is observed for a much longer time frame. The two year time period, having characteristics of both one and three year variations, acts as the transition regime. The normalised NYSE's stock value is found to Granger cause those of BSE, with a time lag of 9 months. Surprisingly, observed Granger causality of high frequency variations reveals BSE behaviour getting reflected in the NYSE index fluctuations, after a smaller time lag. This Janus faced relationship, shows that smaller stock exchanges may provide a natural setting for simulating market fluctuations of much bigger exchanges.

We perform subperiod analysis and find that the long-term contrarian effect is significant in both bullish and bearish states while the short-term contrarian effect disappears in bullish states. We compare the performance of contrarian portfolios based on different grouping manners in the estimation period and unveil that decile grouping outperforms quintile grouping and tertile grouping, which is more evident and robust in the long run. Generally, loser portfolios and winner portfolios have positive returns and loser portfolios perform much better than winner portfolios. Both loser and winner portfolios in bullish states perform better than those in the whole sample period. In contrast, loser and winner portfolios have smaller returns in bearish states in which loser portfolio returns are significant only in the long term and winner portfolio returns become insignificant.

We first prove that every Gromov-Hausdorff geodesic is in fact a geodesic in the Hausdorff hyperspace of some compact metric space, which we call a Hausdorff geodesic. Inspired by this characterization, we further elucidate a structural connection between Hausdorff geodesics and Wasserstein geodesics: every Hausdorff geodesic is equivalent to a so-called Hausdorff displacement interpolation. This equivalence allows us to establish that every Gromov-Hausdorff geodesic is dynamic, a notion which we develop in analogy with dynamic optimal couplings in the theory of optimal transport.   Besides geodesics in $\\mathcal{M}$, we also study geodesics on the collection $\\mathcal{M}^w$ of isomorphism classes of compact metric measure spaces. Sturm constructed a family of Gromov-type distances on $\\mathcal{M}^w$, which we denote $d_{\\mathcal{GW},{p}}^\\mathrm{S}$ (for $p\\in[1,\\infty)$), and proved that $(\\mathcal{M}^w,d_{\\mathcal{GW},{p}}^\\mathrm{S})$ is also a geodesic space.

Game theory has been proven as a very effective tool in modelling decision making processes of intelligent agents, entities, and players. It has been used to model scenarios from diverse fields such as economics, evolutionary biology, and computer science. In defence applications, there is often a need to model and predict actions of hostile actors, and players who try to evade or out-smart each other. Modelling how the actions of competitive players shape the decision making of each other is the forte of game theory. In past decades, there have been several studies which applied different branches of game theory to model a range of defence-related scenarios. This paper provides a structured review of such attempts, and classifies existing literature in terms of the kind of warfare modelled, the types of game used, and the players involved. The presented analysis provides a concise summary about the state-of-the-art with regards to the use of game theory in defence applications, and highlights the benefits and limitations of game theory in the considered scenarios.", "arxiv_id": "abs/2111.01876v1", "primary_category": ["cs"], "secondary_category": ["GT"]}, "abs/nlin/0512015v1": {"id": "d0ddd6ffa982cda60f333ae15a70417a5684b9c7", "title": "A Predictive Theory of Games", "authors": ["David H. Wolpert"], "abstract": "Conventional noncooperative game theory hypothesizes that the joint strategy of a set of players in a game must satisfy an \"equilibrium concept\". All other joint strategies are considered impossible; the only issue is what equilibrium concept is \"correct\". This hypothesis violates the desiderata underlying probability theory. Indeed, probability theory renders moot the problem of what equilibrium concept is correct - every joint strategy can arise with non-zero probability. Rather than a first-principles derivation of an equilibrium concept, game theory requires a first-principles derivation of a distribution over joint (mixed) strategies. This paper shows how information theory can provide such a distribution over joint strategies. If a scientist external to the game wants to distill such a distribution to a point prediction, that prediction should be set by decision theory, using their (!) loss function. So the predicted joint strategy - the \"equilibrium concept\" - varies with the external scientist's loss function. It is shown here that in many games, having a probability distribution with support restricted to Nash equilibria - as stipulated by conventional game theory - is impossible. It is also show how to: i) Derive an information-theoretic quantification of a player's degree of rationality; ii) Derive bounded rationality as a cost of computation; iii) Elaborate the close formal relationship between game theory and statistical physics; iv) Use this relationship to extend game theory to allow stochastically varying numbers of players.", "arxiv_id": "abs/nlin/0512015v1", "primary_category": ["cs", "math", "math"], "secondary_category": ["GT", "GM", "PR"]}, "abs/quant-ph/0501088v4": {"id": "01d248b508484420eae62500da31d1e76ea25a94", "title": "Hamiltotian Formalism of Game Theory", "authors": ["Jinshan Wu"], "abstract": "A new representation of Game Theory is developed in this paper.

By this formulism, a new way to find the equilibria of games is given by generalizing the thermodynamical evolutionary process leading to equilibrium in Statistical Mechanics. And in this formulism, when quantum objects instead of classical objects are used as the objects in the game, it's naturally leads to the so-called Quantum Game Theory, but with a slight difference in the definition of strategy state of players: the probability distribution is replaced with a density matrix. Further more, both games of correlated and independent players can be reached in this single framework, while traditionally, they are treated separately by Non-cooperative Game Theory and Coalitional Game Theory. Because of the density matrix is used as state of players, besides classical correlated strategy, quantum entangled states can also be used as strategies, which is an entanglement of strategies between players, and it is different with the entanglement of objects' states as in the so-called Quantum Game Theory. At last, in the form of density matrix, a class of quantum games, where the payoff matrixes are commutative, can be reduced into classical games.

In particular, probability theory and game theory can disagree on calculated values of the Fisher information, the log likelihood function, entropy gradients, the rank and Jacobian of variable transforms, and even the dimensionality and volume of the underlying probability parameter spaces. These differences arise as probability theory employs structure preserving isomorphic mappings when constructing strategy spaces to analyze games. In contrast, game theory uses weaker mappings which change some of the properties of the underlying probability distributions within the mixed strategy space. Here, we explore how using strong isomorphic mappings to define game strategy spaces can alter rational outcomes in simple games . Specific example games considered are the chain store paradox, the trust game, the ultimatum game, the public goods game, the centipede game, and the iterated prisoner's dilemma.

The geometric quantities in space will be expressed by the lengths of the six edges of a given tetrahedron. In Intercenter Geometry, a unified approach is used to deal with the calculation of geometric quantities of triangles and tetrahedrons. Many new theorems and formulas on geometry and geometric inequalities have been obtained. In particular, Intercenter Geometry has solved some problems that have not been solved in Euclidean geometry and analytical geometry (coordinate geometry) for a long time, such as the distance between the centroid and the incenter of a given tetrahedron, etc. Intercenter Geometry enriches geometry, which is not only of theoretical significance to open up the field of mathematical research, to explore new ideas and methods of mathematical research, but also of positive significance to promote the spirit of innovation.
